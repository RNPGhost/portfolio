        I am currently working as a Software Developer, having completed a four year
        Masters Degree in Computer Science at Oxford University. This combination of
        theoretical and industry experience has given me the skills and confidence 
        needed to design and develop my own games, such as the FPS '2DV' and the turn
        based puzzle mobile game 'Lights Out'.

        Ever since peering over my dad’s shoulder as he played the first Tomb Raider
        on PC, I’ve been fascinated by games. I now spend the vast majority of my
        free time playing, watching, analyzing, designing and developing games. I
        particularly enjoy RPGs such as 'The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim' and the Dark
        Souls series, as well as FPSs such as the Battlefield series.
      </p>

        When not gaming, I spend my time dancing, kayaking and practicing martial
        arts. I have competed with the Oxford University Dancesport Team in Ballroom
        and Latin dances as well as Salsa, and have been teaching Salsa classes for
        the last two years. In 2014, I took part in a 10 hour continuous dance
        marathon to help raise money for Cancer Research UK, and loved every second
        of it.
